# Github viewer is a tool for reading repos

### Demo

Visit: http://jiyinyiyong.github.com/github-viewer/page/ to see it.  

The division on top is the user profile. The right one is file list.  
Mouse turning to hand means you can click here..  
Append a hash tag `#jiyinyiyong` to specify the username.  

It's totally an exercise for Github API. It's nice.  

I reached Github API's limit and I tried to use an application key.  
..That's it.

### Goal

Just a test if I can generate a static blog with file free lists..

### Failed :(

Failed at crossing domain request... It only runs as a client version.
